# Solver - A-Level Computer Science Project
###### Project by Luke T. Hadley, created as a coursework section of Specification AQA A-Level 7517 
---

This repository contains the code for my A-Level Computer Science corsework from 2019.
Below are a few snippets from the written section of the corsework as well as a video that was submitted alongside the written element showing the program working in full.


## Introduction
Though this project I will be creating a maze game for players to traverse thought a randomly generated or custom grid with the aim of the game to finish the game in the shortest number of moves. I shall be implementing the A-Star algorithm as a way of calculating the shortest number of moves from a starting position in a grid to the finishing position.

## Proposed Solution
To make my game will be implementing the A* path finding algorithm to traverse through randomly generated mazes that will be displayed to the player. The player will then be scored on how quickly and simply they reach the finishing point from the start. The algorithm will be used to find the smallest number of moves to solve the maze and use that information to help the player if they get stuck on the ‘level’, and to score them on how efficient they were at solving the ‘level’. Different players will also be given the option to make their own ‘account’ in the program where score data will be saved to an external database file using SQL.
